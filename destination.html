    <p>Travel to Egypt, a great land with a lot of treasure, maybe if you go, you will find it, find more information about how to get there in the traveling methods page.

You might be thinking that you won’t be able to find it, but you should believe in yourself because that is the most important thing that leads to success. You might be wondering, how does believing in yourself shape your success/failure through your journey? If you believe in yourself, you will never give up, and if you don’t give up, you won’t fail, “This is what you’ve always wanted: to travel. So travel. The world is full of wonderful places. And you only need to find the treasure.” (Coelho). This causes you to succeed, for example Elon Musk never gave up through his struggles and now he is the CEO of Tesla. Another example is when Santiago from Alchemist never gave up and found the treasure eventually. That is why the theme of the story is to never give up and it gets developed by Santiago facing obstacles and not giving up.
